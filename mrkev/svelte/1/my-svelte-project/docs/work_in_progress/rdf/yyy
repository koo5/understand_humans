						seems to have a more freeform attitude, yet still keyboard friendly.

						maybe useful for some creative mindmapping, but the navigation doesn't seem suited for factual work?

						keyboard based navigation between nodes, so far the closest to what i'd want in a rdf viewer
						implicit "is-part-of" relation, other relations possible but not keyboard navigable

						basic, browser based, not sure if it supports "custom" links

						no "custom" links, even in latest version
						Qt (probably snappier than java)

					note
						an issue with all of them so for is a lack of automatic layouting for "non-primary" connections, ie, nodes are layouted by their "part-of" relationship, and you can choose different presentations of that, or move a child node into different slots of the parent node, but once you add a "custom" relation, you have to position it yourself. But we could tackle that.
