# i'm collecting notes here that have been scattered across many places, and not all of them are immediately relevant for "delogic". Will reorganize later.

* robust frontend
	* pages
		* request page
			* bound to url: /request/{id}
			* components:
				* status text:
					* completed
					* completed, with alerts
					* completed, with error
					* processing
					* other (payment required, pending, failed, ..)
				* alerts
				* reports
			

* robust/cubicweb/promnesia sneaky
	* implementations
		* greasemonkey script
		* firefox extensions api - promnesia
		* mitmproxy - useless with modern web apps (facebook...)

jballint has the chrome extension, that sends events to the database, and then searches the database from emacs. For firefox, he suggested that i build it with webextensions api, but actually there is already a suitable project: https://beepb00p.xyz/promnesia.html

it can actually be thought of as two separate functionalities of the extension: sending info to the backend, and displaying info

and, well, according to my latest research, i think at least epiphany browser is integrated with tracker(backend) or maybe zeitgeist, and that's queryable with synapse(an omnibar)

there may be a couple other projects/integrations like that, like KRunner

what i discussed with you was the proxy to insert annotations directly into webpages










# tau

at this point:
i still don't have a good understanding of the weird pyramid that HMC proposed:
	at the bottom there's datalog
	datalog interprets type theory
	datalog interprets lambda calculus, that's weird


















Achievements in logic programming are listed; some techniques developed for other languages are pointed out, and some trends for further research are drawn. Among the main achievements are algorithmic debugging, tracing for sequential Prolog, and abstract interpretation. The main missing techniques are slicing, test case generation, and program mutation. The perspectives we see are integration, evaluation, and above all, automated static and dynamic analysis.
