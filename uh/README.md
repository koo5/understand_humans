# understand_humans
## what
A continuation of the idea of a universal shell. Intended to be simple enough to implement by one person, installable with one command, and useful out of the box. Simple core, extensible architecture. A command line client and a service exposing, over configured data sources: fulltext search, search in structured data, and other services. Iniitally focusing on notes, bookmarks, controlling your computer and discovering new software and data sources.
